## General info

Słowotok is a word game where your task is to guess the hidden word in up to 6 attempts. After you type the first word, the color of the letters will change to show you how close you are to guessing the word. If the letter is in the right place, its color will change to green. A letter that is in the password but not in the typed place is displayed in yellow. A letter that is not in the password will be marked in gray.

### :video_game: Two game modes :video_game:

Unlimited mode
In this mode you can play as much as you want! You can choose the length of the word and the number of attempts in which you will try to guess it. 

Words of the Day mode
A daily challenge in which there are three five-letter words to guess. Have you successfully solved all the words of the day? Enter the calendar and play the previous days so that you complete the whole month!

This is my first application published in the Google Play Store.
